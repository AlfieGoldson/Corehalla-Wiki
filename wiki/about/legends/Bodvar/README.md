# Bödvar
**The Unconquered Viking, The Great Bear**

Bödvar is the flagship legend of Brawlhalla featuring the **Hammer** and **Sword** as his weapons.

> Convinced he would never fall in battle, Bödvar the Bearson kicked down the doors of Valhalla and let himself in.
> <div style="text-align: right"><em>- Mallhalla purchase description</em></div>

## As the story goes...

> I speak, you noble vikings, of a warrior who surpassed you all. I tell of a great bear-man who overcame giants and armies, and of how he came to leave our world and challenge the Gods.
> <div style="text-align: right"><em>- The Saga of Bödvar Bearson, first stanza</em></div>

Born of a viking mother and bear father, Bödvar grew up feared and mistrusted by his own people.

Bödvar's first nemesis was the terrible giant bear Grothnar, his own brother. By defeating Grothnar in a battle that lasted seven days, Bödvar chose to side with humanity and became the protector of the people of the north. He led his Skandian People against the Witch Queen of Helheim, slew the White Dragon Sorcerer, and lived the life of an all-conquering hero.

After he single-handedly ended the Giant Wars by trapping the fire giant king in his own volcano, Bödvar sensed his work was done. But he felt doomed to never be taken by the Valkyries to Valhalla because he could never manage to be defeated in battle. So he travelled to Asgard himself, broke down the doors and let himself in.
Valhalla is everything Bödvar hoped - an endless reward of feasting and fighting, with himself among its greatest champions.

> Listen you nine-mothered bridge troll, I'm coming in, and the first beer I'm drinking is the one in your fist.
> <div style="text-align: right"><em>- Bödvar to Heimdall, the guardian of the gates of Asgard</em></div>

Trivia
Bödvar's default weapons are the Warhammer (hammer) and the Broad Sword (sword).
Bödvar's bot name is Bötvar.
Bödvar was one of the first four Legends to be developed for the game, the others being Cassidy, Lord Vraxx and Orion.
As Bödvar went undefeated in his entire life and made his own entry into Valhalla, he is one of the few Legends in the afterlife of Asgard who can be said to have never actually died.
Bödvar is listed as one of Nix's cold-cases - a rogue soul past it's expiration who was never collected by a psychopomp for the afterlife.
